## Installation
This requires Node.js to install and use. The package.json is already provided, so navigate to the project folder and run npm install.

## Usage
Once you've installed the node modules needed, just run npm index.js and answer the questions. The webpage will generate based on your replies.

## Instructions
- There needs to be at least 1 manager for the program to complete. It is suggested to start with the manager and add employees from there.
- Anytime you run the program, it will replace the HTML - so try to have all your team members and their information ready when you run the program.
- The final deployed page looks similar to below:
